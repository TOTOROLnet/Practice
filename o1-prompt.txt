Principles
1. Simple and direct  1。简单而直接¶
2. No explicit CoT required
2。无需明确的cot¶
The first principles we start with are simple and direct prompting and avoiding providing explicit guidance or CoT. This will interfere with the model's in-built reasoning, raising the risk of overly verbose output, inaccurate results, or even refusals in extreme cases.
我们开始的第一原则是简单而直接的提示，并避免提供明确的指导或COT 。这将干扰该模型的内置推理，从而增加了过度详细的输出，不准确的结果甚至在极端情况下拒绝的风险。

3. Use structured formats
3。使用结构化格式
Using a consistent structure like XML or markdown can help structure your inputs and ensure a more uniform output. In this case we'll use a pseudo XML syntax to give consistent structure to our requests.
使用像XML或Markdown这样的一致结构可以帮助您构建输入并确保更均匀的输出。在这种情况下，我们将使用伪XML语法为我们的请求提供一致的结构。

4. Show rather than tell
4。显示而不是告诉¶
Few-shot prompting also works well with o1 models, allowing you to supply a simple, direct prompt and then using one or two examples to provide domain context to inform the model's response.
很少有射击提示也可以很好地与o1型号合作，因此您可以提供一个简单，直接的提示，然后使用一个或两个示例提供域上下文以告知模型的响应。

<question>
I'm considering collaborating with a competitor on a joint marketing campaign. Are there any antitrust issues I should be aware of?
</question>
<response>
Collaborating with a competitor on a joint marketing campaign can raise antitrust concerns under U.S. antitrust laws, particularly the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (15 U.S.C. §§ 1–7). Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits any contract, combination, or conspiracy that unreasonably restrains trade or commerce among the states.
​
**Key Considerations:**
​
1. **Per Se Illegal Agreements:** Certain collaborations are considered automatically illegal ("per se" violations), such as price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market allocation agreements. For example, in *United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.*, 405 U.S. 596 (1972), the Supreme Court held that market division agreements between competitors are per se illegal under the Sherman Act.
​
2. **Rule of Reason Analysis:** Collaborations that are not per se illegal are evaluated under the "rule of reason," which assesses whether the pro-competitive benefits outweigh the anti-competitive effects. In *Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.*, 441 U.S. 1 (1979), the Court recognized that certain joint ventures between competitors can be lawful if they promote competition.
​
3. **Information Sharing Risks:** Sharing competitively sensitive information, such as pricing strategies or customer data, can lead to antitrust violations. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission caution against exchanges that could facilitate collusion (*Antitrust Guidelines for Collaborations Among Competitors*, 2000).
​
**Recommendations:**
​
- **Define the Scope:** Clearly delineate the parameters of the collaboration to focus on the marketing campaign without involving competitive aspects like pricing or market division.
- **Implement Safeguards:** Establish protocols to prevent the exchange of sensitive information that is not essential to the marketing effort.
- **Legal Consultation:** Given the complexities of antitrust laws, consult with a legal professional to ensure the collaboration complies with all legal requirements.
​
**Conclusion:**
​
While joint marketing campaigns between competitors are not inherently illegal, they must be structured carefully to avoid antitrust pitfalls. Legal guidance is essential to navigate these issues and to design a collaboration that achieves your business objectives without violating antitrust laws.
